### Project Description

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras to predict emotions in images. The model can distinguish between happy and sad faces. Additionally, an interactive Streamlit app has been developed, allowing users to upload their images for emotion prediction.

## How to Use the Emotion Classifier

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion-classifier.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Upload Your Image:**
    - Use the app interface to upload an image.
    - Receive instant predictions on whether the face in the image is happy or sad.

## Project Structure

- **`/models`:** Contains the trained CNN model.
- **`/app`:** Holds the Streamlit application code.
- **`/data`:** Dataset used for training and testing the model.
